Documentation
-------------

Code is commented with <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> comment
blocks. To build a nice html documentation run doxygen command in root
directory:

	$ doxygen

This will produce a doc/html folder with documentation. Just open
doc/html/index.html with your favorite browser.

It needs doxygen for the HTML output and LaTeX with bibtex and ghostscript to
render the equations.
